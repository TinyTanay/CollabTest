#Working with Numbers

print(6)
print("6")
print(3 + 4 * 6)
print((3 + 4) * 6)
#This find the absolute value of a Numbers
my_num = 5
print(abs(my_num))
#This does the power of
print(pow(5, 23))
#This finds the bigger Numbers
print(max(5, 10, 21))
#This finds the smaller Numbers
print(min(5, 10, 21))
#This will round Numbers
print(round(5.6))
print(round(5.2))
#In order to add more functions simply typer
from math import *
#Then there are some more functions.
#To find the floor function
print(floor(3.2))
#To find the ceiling function.
print(ceil(3.2))
#This is one final useful function to square root a Numbers
print(sqrt(36))
